Today, we are releasing the final iteration on the 0.12.x line which includes a ton of bug fixes and documentation cleanup. The details of this release can be found below. This release paves the road for our 0.13.0 release that will likely follow next with several substantial changes in place. The details of this 0.12.4 release can be found below.</p>
<h2 id="mounter-supports-rack">Mounter Supports Rack</h2>
<p>The Padrino Mounter has always been one of the cores of our framework and allowed the flexible mounting of many different padrino apps within the same project. This functionality is at the heart of the light modular app architecture that powers Padrino. However, until recently the mounter only worked for Padrino apps. With this release, @namusyaka removed that restriction and now we can map any Rack, Grape or Sinatra app into a Padrino project:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax ruby"><code><span class="c1"># config/apps.rb</span>
<span class="no">Padrino</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">mount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'SinatraApp'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">app_file: </span><span class="no">Padrino</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">root</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'sinatra_app/app.rb'</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="no">Padrino</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">mount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Sample::API'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">app_file: </span><span class="no">Padrino</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">root</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'api/app.rb'</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We are excited for our router to be that much more flexible going forward towards 1.0!</p>
<h2 id="fixing-padrino-docs">Fixing Padrino Docs</h2>
<p>A few months ago, we were honored to be brought onto the RubyRogues podcast to discuss the Padrino Framework and explain why we think Sinatra and Padrino are a great way to build modern and maintainable ruby web apps and APIs.</p>

<p>However, we recognize that our framework has a challenge. Our Padrino guides are almost all woefully outdated and unmaintained and our website is old and rusty. We are fortunate to have Matthias Gunther working tirelessly on the awesome Padrino Book but we recognize we need to do better. To get things going, we have merged all of our markdown docs into the main padrino code repository.</p>

<p>We realize this is only a small first step and we know that one of the biggest roadblocks to a real 1.0 release is a substantial refresh of our documentation and our website. More updates about this soon. If anyone is interested in helping with the documentation effort, please reach out to us.</p>

<h2 id="redesigned-admin">Redesigned Admin</h2>
<p>We have introduced a number of exciting improvements to admin in this release. First, with the help of <a href="https://github.com/WaYdotNET">@WaYdotNET</a>, we have completely rewritten the admin interface front-end. The new front-end uses bootstrap, font-awesome and jQuery. A few commits: <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/3f62f747f03991e0bb6ad9774dd3ebacfe73a23c">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/d6afa8febdc3dcdf1bc61668084cd66290ad4390">2</a></p>

<p>This snowballed into a huge team effort so thanks to everyone involved <a href="https://github.com/WaYdotNET">@WaYdotNET</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DAddYE">@DAddYE</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dariocravero">@dariocravero</a>), <a href="https://github.com/ujifgc">@ujifgc</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tyabe">@tyabe</a> and several others! Here’s a few screenshots of our brand new admin pages:</p>

<li>A lot more commits, this was a huge effort!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-brand-identity-on-the-way">New brand identity on the way</h2>
<p>We have started to rebrand ourselves, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tomatuxtemple">@tomatuxtemple</a> we are getting there!.. Welcome the new logo:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/X7n3Kdo.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/X7n3Kdo.png" alt="X7n3kdo" /></a></p>

<p>The new web experience is just around the corner too, so keep your eyes and ears wide open!</p>
<h2 id="upgraded-sinatra-and-http_router">Upgraded Sinatra and http_router</h2>
<p><a href="http://rkh.im/sinatra-1.4">Sinatra 1.4</a> was just released recently, and we have full support for Sinatra 1.4.X in this release. Commits: <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/68e58b4609ec528fc0ea9f8f95ace36dec9b2920">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/ba2cfcdeb1c4428cc19013d09ba05f1383455360">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/15927ecb172f99fca56d243d331729b9194daa91">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/181b844ab93914c88bfd908a5eefe8b67d2aaeef">4</a>, <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/777ee25223a1998f616d648a932d85f94cf199dc">5</a></p>

<p>We have also upgraded to the latest <a href="https://github.com/joshbuddy/http_router">http_router 0.11</a> to address many thread-safety issues and overall performance improvements.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/DAddYE">@DAddYE</a> for putting together the http_router upgrade to 0.11. Commits: <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/c2b56c47b15334f3c3839e4f3614669c1fdc33e2">1</a></p>
<h2 id="csrf-protection">CSRF Protection</h2>
<p>Padrino now supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery">CSRF protection</a> out of the box to enable additional security protection against unauthorized commands being sent to a Padrino application.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/skade">@skade</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dariocravero">@dariocravero</a> for working together to implement this security feature. Commits: <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/3767875ad450ea63f34f26fca0e3646c50f4e802">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/3afb1070ce83a9daccfa40fef8d8c1655c68a103">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/d7f719db9f6f863811c22978ba1329645e828ccb">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/b6ddd1617c9f81868c747bd28edaf35ed1951a6a">4</a>, <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/3f52b59b3b93278346b5c8cc5c98876ec1c78a17">5</a></p>
<h2 id="activesupport-safebuffer">ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer</h2>
<p>In Padrino 0.11.0, we have begun work on improving the security of Padrino out of the box. We all take app security very seriously, and after much discussion decided to introduce a SafeBuffer into Padrino. This will help protect users against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">XSS (Cross-site Scripting) attacks</a>.</p>

<p>This change switches all rendering to use SafeBuffer instead of a raw string. All strings returned from #render are considered escaped. Strings can be marked safe for concatenation using String#html_safe, which turns returns the String as a SafeBuffer.</p>

<p>All helpers have been ported over to use SafeBuffers. The changes follow one general rule: all tag helpers like tag and content_tag escape everything by default while block helpers like content_for and form_for assume that the given content is already escaped.</p>

<p>If you are generating HTML in your helpers, you should now make sure that you call <code>html_safe</code> on the result, so that the HTML is not automatically escaped:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax plaintext"><code>def my_helper
  "&lt;p&gt;hello!&lt;/p&gt;".html_safe
end
</code></pre></div>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/skade">@skade</a> for proposing and putting this together! See commits here: <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/2c89e1fc7b70c4906b291b3781908c02a0d1233e">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/3a00f4bf03f98d39a026fbfd348b82daacb26dad">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/87049be0e30d101bc02a4bca4d7df50e32f32ebf">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/0f179db270089c047736ccae33433f5d6d2ad304">4</a></p>

<p>This is a direct port of the functionality present in Rails, so thanks to the whole Rails team as well.</p>
<h2 id="new-rakefile-format">New Rakefile format</h2>
<p>Another source of frustration for users was the missing <code>Rakefile</code>: now, every new project has one by default. `padrino rake` still continues to work, but bare `rake` works just as nice as well. Also, the Rakefile format has changed: instead of implicitly loading rake tasks that fit your environment, this is now explicit and looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax plaintext"><code>require 'padrino-core/cli/rake'
PadrinoTasks.use(:sequel)
PadrinoTasks.use(:database)
PadrinoTasks.init
</code></pre></div>
<p>This makes it easier to replace tasks you don’t want to use and leads to less guessing by the framework. Don&#39;t like our <code>database</code> tasks? Just erase that line. Want to use them again? Just put it back in.</p>

<p>Old Rakefiles still work, but will emit a very visible warning on how to change your Rakefile to the new format. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/skade">@skade</a> for putting this together!</p>
<h2 id="gemified-apps">Gemified Apps</h2>
<p>An often requested feature for Padrino is the ability to easily package a Padrino application as a gem. We have now baked this right into the project generator. If you want to generate an application for use as a gem, we will automatically generate the gem and project structure for you! Simply add the <code>--gem</code> flag when generating a project:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax plaintext"><code>padrino g project my_gemified_app --gem
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will generate a Padrino project within the context of a gem structure for you automatically. Now you can publish your Padrino apps as standalone gems with ease. After generation, see the README for more information about how to mount your gemified into Padrino projects.</p>

<p>A gemified project can be started and used like any other padrino project from its root path:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax plaintext"><code>padrino start
</code></pre></div>
<p>But also be included into another project using the <code>Gemfile</code>. For development, you can use the <code>:path</code> option and the project will also be reloaded:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax plaintext"><code>gem 'my_gemified_app' #, :path =&gt; /path/to/my_gemified_app
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can mount apps from other projects like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax plaintext"><code>Padrino.mount('MyFancyApp::App', :app_file =&gt; MyGemifiedApp.root("my_fancy_app", "app.rb")).to('/my_fancy_app')
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is an exciting step for Padrino and creating truly standalone and modular applications that can be easily installed, setup and mounted into an existing Project. We have more plans for this as we approach towards 1.0.</p>

<p>Nothing keeps you from generating your main project as gemified project: there is nothing special about them, gemified projects behave like normal projects with some additions.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/skade">@skade</a> for putting this together! See commits here: <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/2975efa8a6f395b9075b1a7e939fff70412d8e91">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/e470a20f76ed07a218815ba2850a084eae1b8f6a">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/af1efbf18861fb21660481e29821465fa54e4dd8">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/88d575f5404abcfb77c32d9c3df43e46e0399a22">4</a>, <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/74fdf09ea18bbaff25d6a4661a2cc1c6f8b1d7f5">5</a></p>
<h2 id="performance-tools">Performance Tools</h2>
<p>In this release, we have also introduced a <code>padrino-performance</code> gem optionally included as part of your Padrino application. Simply add <code>padrino-performance</code> to your Gemfile. You can use the performance gem to check for well-know errors like multiple loaded json libraries on the console with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax plaintext"><code>bundle exec padrino-performance -j -- bundle exec padrino console
</code></pre></div>
<p>or profile the memory for your application:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax plaintext"><code>bundle exec padrino-performance -m -- bundle exec padrino start
</code></pre></div>
<p>This represents the first step for our built-in memory and performance profiler within Padrino. This will get more love as we approach and move into our 1.0 release. We take performance and memory usage very seriously and are always striving to keep Padrino as lightweight as possible in line with our fast Sinatra foundations.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/skade">@skade</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dariocravero">@dariocravero</a> for working together to get this to a solid place. You can find more details about this on the <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/tree/master/padrino-performance">README</a> and <a href="ttps://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/pull/1027">PR</a></p>
<h2 id="app-namespacing">App Namespacing</h2>
<p>In addition to supporting gemified Padrino application, we have also taken another step towards modular design by introducing app namespacing. In the past, if a Padrino project was generated with the name “sample_blog”, then the application name would just be <code>SampleBlog</code>.</p>

<p>Starting with 0.11.0, generated project now have namespaced apps within a module. For example, if you generate a Padrino project named “sample_blog” with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax plaintext"><code>padrino g project sample_blog --orm activerecord
</code></pre></div>
<p>The primary app file will still be located in “app/app.rb” but the class will be <code>SampleBlog::App</code>. Similarly, everything else has been changed to support the namespacing to allow a project to be roughly self-contained within a single namespace.</p>

<p>One caveat is that to avoid any issues with various ORMs, models are <strong>not generated</strong> within the app namespace. Models will be continued to be generated outside of any namespace for simplicity.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/achiu">@achiu</a> and Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/skade">@skade</a> for working together to finalize this and make this compatible with the new app gem support introduced as well.</p>
<h2 id="project-modules">Project Modules</h2>
<p>Along with gemified apps, a new feature entered padrino-core: Project Modules. Those allow projects to live somewhere else then the applications root path and are a simple, yet powerful way of modularization. Project modules are tracked by the reloader and thus easy to use during development. A project module for a gemified app looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax plaintext"><code>require 'padrino-core'
module GemifiedProject
  extend Padrino::Module
  gem! "gemified_project"
end
</code></pre></div>
<p>A project module will have its own root, so if you want to safely generate a path inside a gemified app, you should use the project module instead of <code>Padrino</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax plaintext"><code>GemifiedProject.root("config", "database.rb")
</code></pre></div>
<p>Project Modules, like <code>Padrino</code> have <code>dependency_paths</code> to play around with that are tracked by the reloader:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax plaintext"><code>GemifiedProject.dependency_paths &lt;&lt; "#{MyModule.root}/uploaders/*.rb"
</code></pre></div>
<p>The nice thing is that <code>gem!</code> is only a helper that indicates that this module should be loaded from a gem, along with proper tracking of the gems root path. You can also set up your own project module by hand, if you want to use some other form of organization. Just set the <code>root</code> correctly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax plaintext"><code>module MyProject
  extend Padrino::Module
  self.root = "/my/fixed/folder"
end
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can use the Module for project namespacing, if you want to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax plaintext"><code>module MyProject
  class MyModel
  end
end
</code></pre></div><h2 id="optimized-reloader">Optimized Reloader</h2>
<p>As many of you might know, the Padrino development reloader has been a common point of frustration and trouble for us. There is still a ways to go and we have some plans on how to replace the reloader for 1.0. Still, in 0.10.7, the reloader would in certain cases for large projects become increasingly slow. In extreme cases, reloading could take as long as 10+ seconds.</p>

<p>Several people helped us track this down and the reloader is substantially faster in this release. The primary fix was thanks to <a href="https://github.com/dcu">@dcu</a> who helped us clean up our traversal of object space and substantially speed of the reloader in extreme cases. <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/d9ab01665534a66b6f891a2efbc6b377c8134b76">commit</a>. We also fixed a thread-safety issue thanks to <a href="https://github.com/udzura">@udzura</a>. Thanks guys!</p>

<h2 id="cache-parser">Cache Parser</h2>
<p>We have also added a parser strategy pluggable interface for the padrino-cache. Now, you can select how the cache data is serialized into your cache store of choice. By default, we now store the data as plain text unless otherwise specified.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax plaintext"><code>Padrino.cache = Padrino::Cache::File.new(...)
Padrino.cache.parser # =&gt; Padrino::Cache::Parser:Plain
Padrino.cache.parser = :marshal
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or you can write your own:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax plaintext"><code>require 'oj'
module PadrinoJSON
  def self.encode(code)
    Oj.dump(code)
  end
  def self.decode(code)
    Oj.load(code)
  end
end
</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally you can load your strategy:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="syntax plaintext"><code>Padrino.cache.parser = PadrinoJSON
</code></pre></div>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/DAddYE">@DAddYE</a> for putting the parsing strategy system into place. <a href="https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/commit/24543be6d34899c76eb6f36f62d5bc2dc7843c35">commit</a></p>
<h2 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h2>
<p>Lots of bug fixes and other changes in this release, see our <a href="http://www.padrinorb.com/changes">changelog</a> for a full rundown.</p>
<h2 id="explicit-by-default">Explicit by default</h2>
<p>A notable change comes in the philosophy of the framework: Instead of guessing application and task locations based on your bundle and project setup, Padrino will now use an explicit version (like setting the <code>:app_file</code> parameter for <code>Padrino.mount</code> and using <code>PadrinoTasks.use</code> in Rakefiles). This makes it far easier for users to replace them and makes it clearer what gets loaded and what doesn&#39;t. It also avoids frustrating mis-guesses by the framework. The old ways will still work for quite a while, but we believe that less magic is the way to go in the future. This is no API change, the underlying API was always there, its just used in another way.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>As we mentioned, this is probably one of the bigger releases we have had in a long time, but we will keep the momentum moving and probably be out with a 0.11.1 release in the next couple weeks. Please let us know if you run into any problems (especially when upgrading from 0.10.X).</p>
